### Project Title: Cars Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Project Overview:**  
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a structured dataset containing information about car sales in Ukraine, primarily focusing on used cars. The aim is to practice and demonstrate Python skills related to data loading, inspection, wrangling, exploration, and drawing insights from the data.

### Dataset Overview:

- **Scope:** This dataset contains data for over 9,500 car sales, primarily used cars in Ukraine.
- **Features:** Various attributes related to car operation, sales, and registration, including price, mileage, engine type, and registration status.

### Objectives:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection:**
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Inspect the structure and basic statistics of the dataset.

2. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Transform data types as needed for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the dataset to answer key questions related to car sales.
   - Utilize visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots.

### Key Questions Addressed:

1. **Which type of cars are sold the most?**
   - Analyze and visualize the frequency of different car types.

2. **What is the correlation between price and mileage?**
   - Use correlation coefficients and scatter plots to assess the relationship.

3. **How many cars are registered?**
   - Count the number of registered vs. non-registered cars.

4. **Price distribution between registered and non-registered cars:**
   - Compare price distributions using box plots.

5. **What is the car price distribution based on Engine Value?**
   - Visualize price distribution segmented by engine value.

6. **Which Engine Type of cars do users prefer the most?**
   - Analyze and visualize preferences for different engine types.

7. **Distribution of Price:**
   - Create histograms to show the overall price distribution of cars.

### Tools Used:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation and wrangling.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.

### Conclusion:  
This EDA project offers valuable insights into the used car market in Ukraine, allowing for a better understanding of sales trends and customer preferences. By addressing key questions, the analysis not only demonstrates the practical application of Python skills but also provides actionable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.
